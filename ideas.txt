- Use big images of healthy people and pictures of the bar in the center (big stock images would make things look more like real and lifestyle. We want to sell a lifestyle.) - kinda like: http://www.fullfatstudios.co.uk/
- Use the ribbon throughout
- Do something more like http://www.thermometerapp.com/ - where it's one page and then there's a bar. (maybe this is too small time looking though. We want to look big.)
- use a big ribbon like on http://www.bam.com.au/
- cliff bar feels like a cliff bar.
- and nature valley uses large images to sell their lifestyle and aura - http://www.naturevalley.com/
- power bar and cliff bar put pictures of their bars on their website. believe bar needs this.
= http://www.doughgirl.com/ is a high class packaged product but their site has a small feel. the site kinda looks like their packaging, plus the feel of old timey. i like the large font because you don't need a lot of text. I like how they list their doughs too. we could do that with bars. i like how they have a newsletter and you can follow them on twitter and facebook.
- i like how they have a 'Call Us'
- i like how they have a contact
